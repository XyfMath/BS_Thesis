This project contains codes that I used in my graduation project at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
To run the code, the scImpute library is required, which can be acquired from https://github.com/Vivianstats/scImpute.
alra.R is directly acquired from https://github.com/KlugerLab/ALRA without editting.
